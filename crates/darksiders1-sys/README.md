# darksiders1-hook

Low-level bindings to `darksiders1.exe`.

## How to generate bindings

The developers were generous enough to include a PDB with the game, so creating bindings is super easy! Just run this command:

```sh
pdbindgen \
    /path/to/darksiders1.pdb \
    -o src \
    -i ^gfc__Darksiders__onPostUpdateInterval$
```
